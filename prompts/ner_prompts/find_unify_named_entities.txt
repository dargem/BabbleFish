### INSTRUCTION:
You are a literary analyst tasked with Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Your goal is to extract all named entities that require consistent translation in fiction.
Be incredibly liberal in your selection, find as many Entities as you can. 
Include anything that functions as a unique or culturally significant reference, including proper nouns, specialized terms, or repeated motifs that a translator should render consistently.

### EXAMPLES:
The types of information to extract are in the following:
- Personal names: First names, last names, or full names (e.g., "Elizabeth", "Barnes", "Elizabeth Barnes", "Darcy")
- Locations and places: Real or fictional (e.g., "The Grand Oak Hotel", "Oakwood", "Erebor")
- Named objects or artifacts: (e.g., "Cloak of Invisibility", "Ring of Oblivion", "Sword of Truth")
- Titles and honorifics (when used as identifiers): (e.g., "Lord Commander", "The Oracle", "Archmage")
- Groups, factions, or organizations: (e.g., "The Night Watch", "Order of the Phoenix", "The Syndicate")
- Mythical or unique creatures (if named or species-like): (e.g., "Balrog", "Niffler", "Kirin")
- Spells, techniques, or special abilities: (e.g., "Shadow Step", "Crimson Lotus Slash")
- Cultural or invented terms that are not translated literally: (e.g., "chakra", "Reaping Day", "The Ascension")

Formatting Instructions:
Output only the extracted names, separated by commas, with no extra commentary or explanation.
Preserve original capitalization.
If no named entities are found, output: null

Return only matches in the writing below:
